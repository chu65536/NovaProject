# NovaProject
Project for NOVA company

This is my first time completing such tasks and I've never used GitHub before.
So, I think this is a perfect moment to start with.

Also I've never written any code on Django framework so it will be very useful and educational

How it works:

1. Ask me to run server :)
2. In case access token expired run refreshtoken.py
3. Run serverrequest.py

Done!
