# NovaProject
Project for NOVA company

This is my first time completing such tasks and I've never used GitHub before.
So, I think this is a perfect moment to start with.

Also I've never written any code on Django framework so it will be very useful and educational

______
How it works:

1. Ask me to run server refresh token and give you ngrok link :)
2. Edit ngrok link in serverrequest.py
3. Run serverrequest.py (or create request manually)

Done!
